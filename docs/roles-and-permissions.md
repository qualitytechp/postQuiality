# Roles and permissions

**Status: CURRENT**

FloCafe currently has five fixed staff roles: owner, manager, cashier, server, and chef. This document describes the default role boundaries in the application. It is a read-only reference - it does not configure access.

The same read-only matrix is available in the Staff page for owners and managers. The runtime source of truth is [`shared/role-permissions.ts`](../shared/role-permissions.ts): backend route gates use its `ROLE_ACCESS` groups, and the in-app table is generated from its `PERMISSION_CAPABILITIES` list. This means the displayed matrix stays accurate when a route changes **if the route and capability are updated to use the shared constants**; it is not a separate database or IAM policy.

## Permission matrix

A check means the role is allowed to use the capability. A dash means it is not allowed. The table groups capabilities by area and uses the same capabilities shown in Staff > Role permissions.

## Important scope notes

- **Read-only display:** The in-app table does not offer role editing, permission toggles, or IAM configuration. These permissions are currently fixed by role. Role configuration/IAM is not available yet.
- **Owner and manager visibility:** The matrix is rendered only for an authenticated owner or manager on the Staff page. The API continues to enforce authorization independently; hiding a UI control is not a security boundary.
- **KDS scope:** Chef access is further narrowed by assigned `category_ids` and kitchen stations. Owner and manager KDS access is unrestricted by category, subject to the KDS being enabled.
- **Server App:** The standalone Server App is intentionally restricted to `server`, `manager`, and `owner` roles. It is separate from the dashboard navigation.
- **Staff management:** Managers can manage operational staff, but cannot modify or deactivate owner/manager accounts. Only owners can change roles for an existing account, and the last active owner cannot be demoted.
- **Permanent delete and merge:** Owner-only, and not represented as a matrix capability — it's a maintenance escape hatch, not a day-to-day surface. Deactivation (above) is the normal way to remove access; it's reversible and keeps every historical reference intact. `DELETE /api/staff/:id` only succeeds when the account has zero references anywhere in the schema (refused with 409 otherwise). `POST /api/staff/:id/merge` reassigns every one of those references to a chosen target account, then deletes the source — for the common case of real order/bill/cash-session history that has to keep resolving to *someone*. Neither can target the last active owner, and neither can be used on the signed-in owner's own account (its session would 401 on the very next request).
- **Customer permanent delete:** Same shape, owner-only, also not a matrix capability. `DELETE /api/customers/:id` only succeeds when the customer has zero orders, bills, held orders, loyalty transactions, or WhatsApp messages on record (refused with 409 otherwise) — a record created by mistake, not a real customer's history. There is no customer merge; a customer with any activity can only be edited or left as-is.
- **Conditional surfaces:** Business type, feature settings (such as KDS or WhatsApp), and account state can hide or disable a surface without changing the fixed role boundary.

## Research-backed presentation choice

The in-app version uses roles as columns and capabilities as rows, with grouped areas, a semantic HTML table, explicit Allowed/Not allowed text paired with check/dash icons, and horizontal overflow with a sticky capability column. This keeps cross-role comparison fast while preserving table semantics and context at narrow desktop widths. The pattern follows [W3C table guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/), [GOV.UK table guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/), and [WCAG guidance on non-color state indicators](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html).
